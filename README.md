**PREDICTION USING SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING**


**TASK:** Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning

**Objective:** To predict the percentage of the students based on the number of study hours.

**Dataset link:** http://bit.ly/w-data

**Dataset characteristics:**
Hours (no of hours student studied), Scores (% of the student)

**Analysis:**
Firstly I found summary of the data to understand the data. Then I plotted the scatter plot to check whether there is linear relation present or not for these two variables. I found correlation for the data. And given two variables are linear and target variable- Scores is continuous hence I used linear regression model to predict students scores. Using test data I tested the model and found R-squared.
